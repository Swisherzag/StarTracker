# StarTracker
An AR-based application that uses Augmented Reality to educate users on Constellations and the Planets that make them up.



--- IN THE SECTION BELOW, THIS SETS THE LAYOUT AND ARCHITECHTURE ON WHICH THE APPLICATION WILL BE BASED AROUND. (subject to change) ---


Frontend:


User Interface (UI):
Develop the user interface using a framework like React Native or Flutter for cross-platform

AR Integration:
Utilize AR libraries like ARCore (Android) and ARKit (iOS) to implement the augmented reality
features.

Location Services:
Use device GPS and location services to determine the user's location and display the correct
star chart.

Camera Integration:
Integrate the device's camera to display the live view for augmented reality features.

User Interactions:
Implement touch and gesture recognition for user interactions with the AR objects.

Search and Navigation:
Develop search functionality and navigation components to allow users to find celestial objects
and access information.

Backend:


Server:
Set up a server to handle user accounts, user-generated content, and premium features.

Database:
Use a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user data, celestial object information, and
user-generated content.

APIs:
Create RESTful APIs to communicate between the mobile app and the server.

Astronomical Data:

Astronomical Algorithms:
Implement algorithms for calculating celestial object positions and their appearances based on
location and time.

Data Sources:
Source astronomical data from reliable sources, such as NASA, for accurate information on
stars, constellations, and other celestial objects.

Notifications:

Push Notifications:
Set up push notification services to send alerts about upcoming celestial events.

(Content Management)

Educational Content Management:
Develop a content management system (CMS) to manage and serve educational articles, videos,
and tutorials.

(Community Features)

User Profiles:
Allow users to create and manage profiles, customize preferences, and track their stargazing
journeys.

Social Features:
Implement social features like user-generated content sharing, comments, and likes.

Offline Mode:
(Caching)
Implement caching mechanisms to allow users to download star charts and content for offline
use.

Monetization:
